This folder contains source code for case studies that apply various
modern Java features and frameworks.

. ImageCounter -- This case study uses Java object-oriented features
  to count the number of images reachable from a recursively-defined
  folder structure.  The root folder can either reside locally
  (filesystem -based) or remotely (web-based).

. BardWords -- This case study shows how Java's BreakIterator, regular
  expression methods, and other object-oriented features can be used
  to search the complete works of Shakespeare for given words and
  phrases.

. ThreadJoinTest -- This case study uses modern Java features (such as
  lambdas and method references) and very modern Java features (such
  as virtual threads) to search for famous phrases in the complete
  works of William Shakespeare.

. ImageStreamGang -- This case study provides a program that
  compares/contrasts the performance of different sequential,
  concurrent, parallel, and reactive programming features available in
  modern Java.
