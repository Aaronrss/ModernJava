<h3>Java Object-Oriented and Functional Array (Assignment 1)</h3>

<p>The objective of this assignment is to give you experience using
Android Studio to develop and test an implementation of an Array
interface written using Java's object-oriented and functional
programming features.  It's important that your Array implementation
work properly since it is required by all subsequent assignments in
this course.</p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul> <li><a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html">java.utils.Arrays
documentation</A>, which provides certain useful methods for your
Array implementation.</li> <li><a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">The Oracle Java
Tutorial</a>, which provides a good overview of Java's object-oriented
features.</li> </ul>

<p> If your Java knowledge is rusty you might consider watching the
videos in our Coursera <A
HREF="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-for-android/">Java for
Android</A> MOOC. </p>

<HR width=50% align=left> <h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p> Before you start with Assignment 1 you'll need to download and install IntelliJ. Instructions for doing this
are available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/ModernJava/wiki/Installing-Software">here</a>.

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The assignment is packaged as a project using IntelliJ and is
written using modern Java.  For the purposes of Assignment 1 you need
to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A HREF="...">...</A>, which contains
the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  </LI>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A HREF="">...</A>, which is a set of
unit tests that exercise the features you're implementing and are used
to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this assignment's
requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided IntelliJ project.
You can run this project by clicking the green arrow next to the
"ArrayTest" dropdown menu in the IntelliJ IDE.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<p> An Array is an abstract data type (ADT) implemented via a single
contiguous buffer that provides operations like get(), set(), add(),
remove(), size(), replaceAll(), and forEach(). Your task is to
implement a generic Array class in Java.  This class will be different
from Java built-in arrays in various ways, e.g., it can be resized and
used in conjunction with other Java Collection Framework classes. </p>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - you fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  Do not change the overall structure of the skeleton
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks.  In particular, you'll need to finish
implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="">...</A> folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"><A HREF="Array.java">Array.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement the Array class.

<ul> <li>Implement the requirements of the <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html">Iterator</a>
interface.

</ul>

<p> You should avoid using Java loops in this assignment as much as
possible and instead use <CODE>Arrays.copyOf()</CODE> and/or
<CODE>System.arraycopy()</CODE>. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/ModernJava/tree/main/Assignments/FP/assignment1">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  After you've setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="...">...</A> folder are provided to
check that your implementation is working as expected.  As usual,
testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their absence, so
don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in your code.
However, make sure to run these tests prior to submitting your
solution and seek help on the discussion forum if you have questions
about why any of the tests fail.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with
installing/using Java, it's object-oriented and functional features,
IntelliJ, and Git/GitLab/GitHub.  If you find it's extremely hard to
complete this assignment you may not be ready to take this class.  <p>
