This directory contains all the modern Java source code examples from
my online courses at Vanderbilt.  Many of these examples now use
features found in later Java releases, so I recommend installing Java
18 (at least) to avoid compatibility problems.

Here's an overview of what's currently included in these examples:

. ex0 - This example shows two zap*() method implementations that
        remove a string from a list of strings.  One method uses
        traditional Java 7 features and the other uses basic modern
        Java features.

. ex1 - This example use the Java streams framework to generate and
        check sMAX_COUNT positive odd random numbers and print which
        are prime and which are not.
