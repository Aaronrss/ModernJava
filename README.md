This repository contains examples of modern Java features that appear
in various videos I'm creating for my courses at Vanderbilt.  It's
organized into the following folders:

. OO - Examples applying Java object-oriented features
. FP - Examples applying Java functional programming features
. CF - Examples applying the Java completable futures framework
. SP - Examples applying the Java streams framework (both sequential and parallel streams)
. RS - Examples applying Java reactive streams frameworks (e.g., RxJava & Project Reactor)
. CS - Case study examples that apply multiple modern Java features and frameworks
